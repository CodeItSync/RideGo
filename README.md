# RideGo System Documentation (Enhanced)

## 1. System Architecture Diagram (Conceptual Block Diagram)

This conceptual diagram illustrates the **three-tier architecture** of the RideGo application, highlighting communication flows between the backend, mobile clients, and supporting services. The architecture emphasizes scalability, modularity, and security.

| TIER | COMPONENT | TECHNOLOGY / ROLE | COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL | NOTES |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I. Client Tier** | **Admin Web Panel** | Laravel Blade (Web UI) | HTTPS (Session-Based Auth) | Supports role-based access control, data management, and operational analytics. |
| | **Rider Mobile App** | Flutter (iOS & Android) | HTTPS (REST API/JWT) | Consumes API endpoints for ride requests, payment, and notifications. |
| | **Driver Mobile App** | Flutter (iOS & Android) | HTTPS (REST API/JWT) | Handles ride assignments, GPS tracking, and earnings reporting. |
| **II. Application Tier (Backend)** | **Web Server / Load Balancer** | Nginx | HTTP/HTTPS | Distributes requests across multiple Laravel instances; supports SSL termination and caching. |
| | **Laravel Application** | PHP 8+ (API Logic & Business Rules) | REST/JSON | Implements core logic, validation, authentication, and integrates with external services. |
| | **Push Notification Service** | Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) | REST API (from Laravel) | Sends real-time ride status updates, promotional messages, and alerts. |
| | **Mapping/Location Service** | Google Maps API / Mapbox | REST API & WebSocket | Provides routing, distance calculations, geofencing, and real-time tracking. |
| | **Payment Gateway** | Tap Payment / Stripe | REST API (from Laravel) | Handles secure card transactions, wallet top-ups, and subscription billing. |
| **III. Data Tier** | **Primary Database** | MySQL / Aurora (RDS optional) | SQL Queries via Eloquent ORM | Structured storage for users, rides, payments, and system logs; supports ACID transactions. |
| | **Cache Layer** | Redis / Memcached | TCP / Unix Socket | Reduces database load; caches frequent queries, sessions, and rate limits. |
| | **File Storage** | Local Disk / Cloud Storage (S3) | API / File System | Stores ride receipts, profile images, and documents securely. |

**Notes:**
- The system is horizontally scalable with multiple backend instances behind a load balancer.
- Microservice patterns can be introduced for payments, notifications, and analytics in future versions.
- All client-server communication is secured via HTTPS/TLS 1.2+.
- Logging & monitoring are implemented via **Laravel Telescope**, **Sentry**, or **Prometheus/Grafana**.

## 2. Web Frontend Details (Laravel Admin Panel)

The admin panel provides centralized management for operational, financial, and user-related functions.

| Detail | Description for RideGo Admin Panel |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Technology Stack** | Laravel 9+ (PHP 8+) with Blade templating; optionally uses **Livewire** or **Inertia.js** for reactive UIs. TailwindCSS for responsive design. |
| **Routing Setup** | All admin routes are defined in `routes/web.php` and prefixed (e.g., `/admin/`). Protected with `auth:admin` middleware and role-based access. |
| **Authentication & Security** | Session-based authentication with CSRF protection and optional 2FA. Admin actions are logged for audit and compliance purposes. |
| **Component Hierarchy** | Master layout includes: **Sidebar Navigation**, **Header** (notifications & profile), **Content Area** (dynamic Blade views). Reusable components: `DataTable`, `ModalForm`, `ChartWidget`. |
| **Core Functions** | - User Management: CRUD for Riders & Drivers<br>- Ride Management: View, filter, update ride requests<br>- Payment & Wallet Management: Refunds, adjustments, transaction logs<br>- Coupon & Rewards Management<br>- Geographical & Regional Settings<br>- System Analytics & Reports: Ride stats, revenue, driver performance<br>- Notifications & Messaging: Push & email templates<br>- Security & Audit Logs |
| **Operational Notes** | Live data updates via AJAX or Livewire. Role-based dashboards provide targeted metrics. Admin panel supports batch operations (bulk user import/export). |
| **Performance & Optimization** | Uses caching for frequently accessed resources, database query optimization, pagination, and queue workers for heavy tasks like sending notifications or generating reports. |

## 3. Mobile Frontend Details (Flutter Apps: Rider & Driver)

The Flutter apps share a modular architecture to simplify maintenance while addressing role-specific functionality.

| Detail | Description for Rider & Driver Apps (Flutter) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **SDKs & Libraries** | **State Management:** Provider / Riverpod / BLoC<br>**Networking:** Dio for REST API calls with interceptors for token refresh<br>**Maps & Geolocation:** `maps_flutter`, `geolocator`, `flutter_polyline_points`<br>**Notifications:** `firebase_messaging` with local notifications<br>**Secure Storage:** `flutter_secure_storage` for JWTs & sensitive info<br>**Form Validation:** `flutter_form_builder` |
| **Folder Structure** | `lib/`:<br>- `screens/` → Page-level UIs<br>- `widgets/` → Reusable components<br>- `models/` → API data structures & serialization<br>- `services/` → API clients, location, payment integration<br>- `state/` → Business logic & state management<br>- `utils/` → Helpers, constants, validators |
| **Authentication Flow** | User logs in → Laravel API issues JWT access & refresh tokens → Tokens stored securely → API requests include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` → Automatic token refresh handled by interceptors. |
| **Localization (i18n)** | `intl` or `easy_localization`. Translation files in `assets/i18n`. Supports dynamic locale switching and RTL layouts for multiple languages. |
| **Key Components** | **Rider App:** `BookingScreen`, `PaymentSelection`, `RideHistory`<br>**Driver App:** `AwaitingRequestScreen`, `OnTripScreen`, `EarningsReport`<br>**Shared Widgets:** Buttons, loading indicators, modals, map overlays, custom dialogs |
| **Offline & Error Handling** | Offline caching with `Hive` or `SharedPreferences`. Graceful error handling with retries, toast/snackbar notifications, and fallback UI for lost connectivity. |
| **Security & Privacy** | AES-encrypted secure storage, minimal permissions, encrypted communication (HTTPS), and encrypted local data where necessary. |
| **Performance Optimization** | Lazy loading of map tiles, optimized image caching, and asynchronous API calls to ensure smooth UI/UX. |
| **Analytics & Monitoring** | Integration with **Firebase Analytics**, crash reporting, and optional in-app feedback mechanisms. |

## 4. Backend API Design (Laravel)

| Feature | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **API Protocol** | RESTful endpoints returning JSON. Follows REST conventions: GET (fetch), POST (create), PUT/PATCH (update), DELETE (remove). |
| **Authentication** | JWT for mobile apps; session-based for admin panel. Middleware ensures role-based access control. |
| **Rate Limiting & Throttling** | Laravel `ThrottleRequests` middleware to prevent abuse and brute-force attacks. |
| **Validation & Error Handling** | Request validation using Laravel Form Requests. Standardized API responses with HTTP codes and error messages. |
| **Background Jobs** | Queue workers for sending notifications, processing payments, and generating reports. |
| **Logging** | Laravel logging with Monolog; integrates with Sentry or external logging services. |

---

## 5. Security & Compliance

- All data in transit encrypted with TLS 1.2+
- Sensitive user data encrypted at rest
- Role-based access control for admin panel and APIs
- Audit logs for key actions (rides, payments, coupons)
- GDPR & PCI-DSS compliance considerations for user and payment data

---

## 6. Deployment & Scalability

- **Containerization:** Docker for backend and worker processes
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes or Docker Swarm for scaling
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus/Grafana for performance metrics
- **CD/CI:** GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for automated builds, tests, and deployments
- **Load Balancing:** Nginx or AWS ALB for distributing client requests

---

## 7. Notes & Recommendations

- Microservices can be introduced for payments, notifications, and analytics in future versions.
- Consider WebSocket integration for real-time ride tracking.
- Use Cloud Storage (S3, GCS) for media files to improve scalability.
- Enable automated backup of database and cache for disaster recovery.
- Implement unit and integration tests for API endpoints and Flutter modules.
